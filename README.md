## Overview

DocuMenTor combines a DSL for defining the DMS metamodel with an automated generation layer that transforms the DSL specifications into complete, executable Python/Flask web applications.

## The DocuMenTor Environment

The provided DSL implemented with EMF/Xtext allows users to create textual instances describing the DMSs to generate, and declaring their sections, like slots, document types, and other metadata that may vary between each instance. Additionally, the DocuMenTor engine includes a code generator that transforms such models into the pure Flask/Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that constitute the generated DMS web applications which are automatically deployed.
